# AgileFlow User Manual

Welcome to AgileFlow, your team's central hub for managing tasks, scheduling events, and coordinating production workflows. This guide will walk you through the key features of the app.

## 1. Getting Started

### 1.1 Requesting Access
To begin using AgileFlow, you must first request access.
1.  Navigate to the main page.
2.  Click the "Sign up" link.
3.  Enter your email address and click "Request Access".
4.  An administrator will review your request.

### 1.2 Signing In
Once your access has been approved, you can sign in:
1.  Navigate to the login page.
2.  Enter your email and password.
3.  You will be taken to your default calendar view.

## 2. Navigating the App

The main navigation is located on the left sidebar, providing quick access to:
- **Calendar**: Your central scheduling tool.
- **Overview**: A dashboard of key statistics.
- **Tasks**: Your personal and team task lists.
- **Notifications**: Important updates and action items.
- **Settings**: Manage user and application settings.

## 3. Dashboard Overview

The **Overview** page gives you a high-level summary of team activity, including active tasks, tasks due soon, and completed tasks. You can also see a list of your most recent tasks.

## 4. Calendar

The calendar is a powerful tool for visualizing and managing your team's schedule.

### 4.1 Calendar Views & Controls

You can switch between four different views:
- **Month**: A traditional monthly overview.
- **Week**: A 7-day timeline view.
- **Day**: A detailed hourly view for a single day. Can be switched between a horizontal (standard) or vertical (reversed) axis.
- **Production Schedule**: A specialized view showing events organized by location for an entire week.

Use the controls at the top to navigate between dates, jump to "Today", and adjust the view (e.g., zoom in/out).

A subtle diagonal pattern between 12:00 and 14:30 serves as a visual reminder to keep time free for a lunch break.

### 4.2 Production Schedule View

This is the most detailed view, designed for production planning.

- **Daily Checks**: Users with the "Manage Checks" role can add, remove, and assign users to daily check locations that appear as pills at the top of each day.
- **User Statuses**: Managers can assign absence statuses (e.g., PTO, Sick, TOIL) to users. These appear as color-coded pills on the right side of each day's header. Click the pencil icon to open a dialog to manage these statuses.

## 5. Tasks

The **Tasks** page helps you stay on top of your work.
- **Tabs**: Switch between "My Tasks" (tasks assigned to you) and "All Tasks".
- **Grouping**: Tasks are automatically grouped by their current status (e.g., In Progress, Awaiting Review).
- **New Task**: Click the "New Task" button to create a new task.

## 6. Notifications

The **Notifications** page keeps you informed.
- **Unread Count**: A badge shows the number of unread notifications.
- **Access Requests**: Administrators can approve or reject new user access requests directly from the notification list.

## 7. Settings & User Management

The **Settings** page is where you manage users, roles, and personal preferences. Click on any user row to expand it and view detailed options.

### 7.1 For All Users

- **Personal Preferences**: Click the **palette icon** on your own user row to open the preferences popover. Here you can:
    - **Change Colour Scheme**: Choose between `light`, `dark`, or `high-visibility` themes.
    - **Set Default Calendar View**: Select which calendar view you want to see when you log in.
- **Contact Info**: You can edit your own contact phone number.

### 7.2 For Managers & Administrators

Users with the appropriate permissions can manage their teams and the application.

- **Edit Permissions**: Assign or revoke functional permissions (e.g., `Events`, `Production`). Editing high-privilege permissions like `Admin` or `Service Delivery Manager` requires two-factor authentication for security.
- **Manage Roles**: Assign custom roles to users (e.g., `Camera`, `Audio`).
- **Edit Global Roles**: Managers can add or remove roles from the global list available for assignment.
- **Manage Reporting Lines**: Privileged users can define who reports to whom within the team structure.

### 7.3 View As Another User

Administrators can view the application from another user's perspective.
1.  Click your avatar in the bottom-left corner of the sidebar.
2.  Select "View as" from the dropdown menu.
3.  Choose a user from the list.
4.  A banner will appear at the top of the screen indicating whose view you are using. To return to your own view, repeat the process and select "Return to your view".
